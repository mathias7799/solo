# Why?

There's a bunch of SOLO pools outside, and sadly none of them are transparent enough to have any trust. Also, there were incidents when SOLO pools have just stolen blocks. At Flexpool, we decided to develop a self-hosted open-source solution to all this mess.

### üíº Portability

The Flexpool Solo is a highly portable software, and the only dependency you need is the Ethereum node. Also, it uses an embedded lightning-fast key-value [LevelDB database](https://github.com/google/leveldb), so there is no need to set up external ones.

### üèé Speed

The Flexpool SOLO is written in the [Go Programming Language](https://golang.org), which makes it very speedy and more profitable accordingly.

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Optimized Code

The Flexpool SOLO is written by one of the creators of the **Flexpool**, and the source code has some of Flexpool's optimization techniques applied. This pool is designed to be the MOST profitable among all other solo Ethereum pools.

### üíé Support for other coins

This pool is 100% compatible with any other Ethereum fork that uses **Ethash** PoW consensus scheme.
